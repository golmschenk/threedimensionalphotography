# 3D Photography
This repository holds my homework for my 3D Photography class.

## Project 1
#### ICP Variation
The version of ICP implemented here is the simple closest point with pruning based on a distance threshold.

#### Efficiency
The version here is built as a learning exercise, and it not optimized. In its current form, it runs very slowly.

#### Running
A very simple usage of ICP is shown in the `main.py` file. This file is purely for testing parts of the code. The alogrithms are in the `point_cloud.py` and `point.py` files.
